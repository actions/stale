Business Strategy & Outlook 03-11-2022																	
While 2020 was an extremely difficult year for Berkshire Hathaway, with a nearly 10% decline in operating earnings and a more than 40% decline in reported net earnings, the firm's overall positioning improved as the back half of the year progressed. The firm saw an even more marked improvement in its insurance investment portfolio, as well as the operating results of its various subsidiaries, last year.

While these advantages have been overshadowed by an ever-expanding cash balance-ANhich is earning next to nothing in a near-zero interest-rate environment--we believe the company has finally hit a nexus where it is far more focused on reducing its cash hoard through stock and bond investments and share repurchases.
